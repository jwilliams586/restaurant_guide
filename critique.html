Website: phptutorial.codepoint.net


This website is all about learning php and web programming.
It has a few short tutorials about how to get started with web programming.
The first tutorial is to make a basic html file that displays the ever classic "Hello World!" message.
Then it introduces php and how it interacts with html.

Overall this site seems good at just getting a feeling for some of these basic concepts.
There are very few tutorials, only about 10, and each is fairly short.
Obviously web programming has many more topics than these few, but it makes for a nice start.
